    lift_factors(B::AbstractLieAlgHorMatrix)

Factor a horizontal lift into the two ``N\times{}2n`` matrices ``B'`` and ``B''`` with
``\bar{B} = B'(B'')^T``:

```math
\bar{B} = \begin{bmatrix}
    A & -B^T \\
    B & \mathbb{O}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}  \frac{1}{2}A & \mathbb{I} \\ B & \mathbb{O} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}  \mathbb{I} & \mathbb{O} \\ \frac{1}{2}A & -B^T  \end{bmatrix} =: B'(B'')^T.
```

Every retraction in this package is built on this factorisation — it is what makes their cost scale
with ``n`` rather than with ``N``, since the only matrix function either of them evaluates is on the
``2n\times{}2n`` product ``(B'')^TB'``. Both [`geodesic`](@ref) and [`cayley`](@ref) use it, for both
manifolds.

For a [`GrassmannLieAlgHorMatrix`](@ref) this is the same expression with ``A \equiv \mathbb{O}``.

    geodesic(Y::Manifold, Δ, algorithm = ScaledSquaring())

Take as input an element of a manifold `Y` and a tangent vector in `Δ` in the corresponding tangent space and compute the geodesic (exponential map).

In different notation: take as input an element ``x`` of ``\mathcal{M}`` and an element of ``T_x\mathcal{M}`` and return ``\mathtt{geodesic}(x, v_x) = \exp(v_x).``

`algorithm` selects how the exponential is evaluated and is passed straight through to
[`geodesic(::AbstractLieAlgHorMatrix)`](@ref); see [`AbstractExponentialAlgorithm`](@ref) for the
choice. It matters only for a large ``\Delta`` — the default [`ScaledSquaring`](@ref) is accurate at
every step size.

    retraction_differential(retraction, B, α)

The horizontal lift ``D(\alpha)`` that generates the velocity of the curve a line search walks along.

[`trial_iterate!`](@ref) builds its trial point as ``x(\alpha) = \Lambda_0\mathrm{retract}(\alpha\bar{B})E``
with ``\Lambda_0`` the section the step starts from, so with ``W(\alpha) = \Lambda_0\mathrm{retract}(\alpha\bar{B})``
the frame the cache holds afterwards, this returns the ``D(\alpha)`` for which

```math
\frac{dx}{d\alpha} = W(\alpha)D(\alpha)E .
```

[`trial_slope`](@ref) pairs the gradient against it, which is what makes ``\varphi'(\alpha)`` the
derivative of ``\varphi``.

# Implementation

For [`Geodesic`](@ref) this is ``\bar{B}`` itself. The exponential is a one-parameter subgroup, so
``\frac{d}{d\alpha}\exp(\alpha\bar{B}) = \exp(\alpha\bar{B})\bar{B}`` and the frame factors out
whole. The same holds for an ordinary array under either retraction, where the retraction is addition
and ``\varphi`` is affine in ``\alpha``.

[`Cayley`](@ref) is *not* a one-parameter subgroup, and this is what that costs. With
``M = (\mathbb{I} - \frac{\alpha}{2}\bar{B})^{-1}``,

```math
\frac{d}{d\alpha}\mathrm{Cayley}(\alpha\bar{B}) = M\bar{B}M ,
\qquad
D(\alpha) = \mathrm{Cayley}(\alpha\bar{B})^{-1}M\bar{B}M = M^T\bar{B}M ,
```

using ``M^T = (\mathbb{I} + \frac{\alpha}{2}\bar{B})^{-1}`` for skew ``\bar{B}``. ``D`` is skew but
not horizontal; only its first ``n`` columns ever enter — ``D(\alpha)E`` — and the horizontal
projection has the same ones, so what [`lift_from_columns`](@ref) is handed is that projection.

For a [`GrassmannLieAlgHorMatrix`](@ref) the top ``n\times{}n`` block is dropped rather than kept,
and that is not an approximation. ``M``, ``M^T`` and ``\bar{B}`` are all rational functions of
``\bar{B}`` and so commute, which gives

```math
D(\alpha) = \bar{B}\left(\mathbb{I} - \tfrac{\alpha^2}{4}\bar{B}^2\right)^{-1} ,
```

and for a Grassmann lift — where ``A \equiv \mathbb{O}``, so ``\bar{B}^2`` is block-diagonal — the
top-left block of that product is identically zero at every ``\alpha``. The drop is exact whatever
``D`` is paired against, not merely exact against a gradient that happens to be orthogonal to ``Y``.

Both inverses are taken through [`lift_factors`](@ref) and the Woodbury identity, exactly as
[`cayley`](@ref) does, so the cost is ``O(Nn^2 + n^3)`` and no ``N\times{}N`` matrix is formed.

`α = 0` returns `B` unchanged, and that is the case that matters for cost:
[`SimpleSolvers.Backtracking`](@extref) — the default of [`default_linesearch`](@ref) — evaluates
``\varphi'`` only at ``\alpha = 0``, so it never reaches the general branch.
