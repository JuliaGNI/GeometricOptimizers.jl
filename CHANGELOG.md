# Changelog

All notable changes to GeometricOptimizers.jl are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (pre-1.0, so a minor bump is a
breaking release).

## [Unreleased] — targeting 0.2.0

v0.1.0 carried **two parallel optimizer hierarchies**: `src/optimizers/`, ported from
GeometricMachineLearning, which knew about manifolds and was driven by `optimization_step!`, and
`src/euclidean_optimizers/`, which had the newer `OptimizerState` / `solver_step!` / `solve!`
interface but only worked on `AbstractVector`s. This release collapses them into one. `Optimizer` is
now the single entry point and runs over anything the new `OptimizerSolution` union covers — an
`AbstractVector`, a `Manifold`, or a `NamedTuple` of arrays — with the same driver, the same states
and the same caches.

Unifying them meant reading both implementations against each other, which turned up a number of
defects that had been invisible: two of the three first-order methods computed a step that did not
match their own documented formula, two optimizer states were reading uninitialized memory, and
`mul!` on the special matrix types returned the wrong object. Those are fixed here, so **the iterates
this package produces change**, in most cases substantially for the better.

### Removed (breaking)

- **`EuclideanOptimizer` is gone.** Replace `EuclideanOptimizer(x, F; …)` with `Optimizer(x, F; …)`.
- **The old manifold entry points are gone**: `optimization_step!`, `init_optimizer_cache`,
  `setup_gradient_cache` / `setup_momentum_cache` / `setup_adam_cache` / `setup_bfgs_cache`,
  `perform_optimization!`, and the manifold `BFGS` method with its `_BFGSCache`. The
  `Optimizer(method, ps; retraction = cayley)` + `optimization_step!(o, λY, ps, dx)` sequence is
  replaced by `Optimizer` / `OptimizerState` / `solve!`:

  ```julia
  # before
  o = Optimizer(Momentum(), ps; retraction = cayley)
  λY = GlobalSection(ps)
  optimization_step!(o, λY, ps, dx)

  # now
  opt   = Optimizer(ps, L; algorithm = MomentumMethod(), retraction = Cayley())
  state = OptimizerState(MomentumMethod(), ps)
  solve!(ps, state, opt)
  ```

- **`AdamWithDecay` is removed.** It differed from `Adam` only in an exponentially decaying learning
  rate, and the learning rate is now the line search's business (see below); a decaying schedule
  belongs in a `LinesearchMethod`.
- **`Adam`'s `η` field is removed.** It was never applied to the direction, so `Adam(1e-3)` and
  `Adam(1e2)` produced identical results.
- Two stranded test files (`test/optimizer_status_tests.jl`, `test/special_matrices/poisson_tensor.jl`)
  were deleted. Neither was included by `runtests.jl` and both referenced symbols that no longer exist
  (`QuasiNewtonOptimizer`, `PoissonTensor`).

### Changed (breaking)

- **Method types renamed.** `EuclideanOptimizerMethod` → `OptimizerMethod` (there is one abstract type
  now); `Gradient` / `_Gradient` → `GradientMethod`; `Momentum` → `MomentumMethod`. `_BFGS` and `_DFP`
  are unchanged. `GradientMethod`, `MomentumMethod`, `Adam` and their states are now exported.
- **`Adam`'s constructor changed shape.** Because `η` used to be the *first positional* argument, `β₁`,
  `β₂` and `δ` are keyword arguments now, so an old `Adam(1e-3)` call fails loudly instead of silently
  setting `β₁ = 1e-3`. The element type is what `Adam` takes positionally: `Adam(Float32)`. Unlike
  `MomentumMethod`, `Adam` is not converted by `Optimizer`, so the type has to match the parameters.
- **The learning rate moved to the line search.** Every `OptimizerMethod` now produces only a
  *direction*; how far the optimizer goes along it is the line search's `α`. A fixed learning rate `η`
  is `linesearch = Static(η)`, and `Static` is exported for that reason. `default_linesearch` makes
  `Static(1e-3)` the default for `GradientMethod`, `MomentumMethod` and `Adam`, and keeps
  `Backtracking` for the (quasi-)Newton methods, which come with a scale of their own. Previously
  everything defaulted to `Backtracking`.
- **Retractions are passed as instances, not functions**: `retraction = Cayley()` / `Geodesic()`, not
  `retraction = cayley`. The default is `Cayley()`.
- **`MomentumMethod`'s recursion is fixed.** It accumulated `p ← p + α∇L`, which is not momentum but an
  undamped sum: for a constant gradient it grew linearly instead of saturating at `∇L/(1 - α)`, and it
  kept pushing after `∇L → 0`. It is `p ← αp + ∇L` now, with direction `-p`. On the SVD test problem
  the relative error drops from 1.9e-2 to 9.7e-3 — from *worse* than plain gradient descent to
  slightly better, as momentum should be. ([#18])
- **`Adam`'s update formulas are fixed.** Three defects, each of which changes the iterates:
  - the bias correction was evaluated at `t + 1` rather than `t`, making the very first direction
    `0.7425⋅sign(∇L)` instead of the `sign(∇L)` the correction is supposed to give;
  - the recursion factors were `β/(1 - βᵗ)` rather than `(β - βᵗ)/(1 - βᵗ)`, which is what the
    bias-corrected form requires — the former amplifies the moments by up to `1/(1 - β)` in the first
    iterations;
  - the square root was applied to `m₂` instead of to `m̃₂ = m₂ + δ`, i.e. the direction was
    `-m₁/(m₂ + δ)` instead of `-m₁/(√m₂ + δ)`, and it corrupted the stored second moment afterwards.

  Relative error on the SVD problem improves from 1.1e-3 to 1.7e-5 (`Geodesic`) and from 1.7e-3 to
  6.0e-5 (`Cayley`).
- **`_BFGS` and `_DFP` now actually update their inverse Hessian.** `state.ḡ` was refreshed at the end
  of the iteration, i.e. at the very iterate the next secant difference `γ = ∇f(x⁽ᵏ⁾) - ∇f(x⁽ᵏ⁻¹⁾)`
  was formed at, so `γ` was identically zero, `δᵀγ` was zero with it, and the guard around the `Q`
  update skipped it on **every** iteration. `Q` stayed the identity for the whole solve, i.e. both
  methods silently ran as steepest descent. Both caches now advance `ḡ` themselves, right after they
  have used it. On `sum(sin.(x).^2)` from `0.5·ones(3)` with `Backtracking`, `_BFGS` went from
  `1.1e-3` after exhausting all 1000 iterations to machine precision in six.
- **The `_DFP` update uses `γγᵀ` where it used to use `δδᵀ`.** DFP is
  `Q ← Q - Qγγᵀ Q/(γᵀQγ) + δδᵀ/(δᵀγ)` (nocedal2006numerical, eq. 6.15); the rank-one term that is
  subtracted was built from `cache.ΔxΔx`, which also left `cache.ΔgΔg` computed on the line above and
  never read.
- **The (quasi-)Newton directions are checked for descent.** `ensure_descent!` replaces a direction
  with `∇f⋅δ ≥ 0` by the steepest-descent direction. A Newton step only descends where the Hessian is
  positive definite, and up to SimpleSolvers 0.8 the `Bisection` and `Quadratic` line searches hid
  this by returning a *negative* step; they no longer do. Without the safeguard,
  `sum(sin.(x).^2)` from `ones(3)` — where `sin²` has second derivative `-0.83` — converges to `π/2`,
  which is a *maximum*. `Adam` and `MomentumMethod` are deliberately excluded: their direction is a
  moving average and is allowed not to descend on an individual step.
- **`AdamState` and `MomentumState` are zero-initialized.** They used `_similar`, i.e. uninitialized
  memory, which is read on the first `update!` — so the first step depended on whatever happened to be
  in memory, and `Adam` could throw a `DomainError` from `√` of a negative value.
- **`l2norm` of a `NamedTuple` combines the block norms in quadrature** instead of summing them, which
  overestimated the ℓ² norm of the flattened parameters by up to `√k` for `k` blocks — and with it
  every stopping criterion computed from it. Stopping behaviour on `NamedTuple` parameters changes.
- **`mul!(C, A, α)` and `rmul!` on the special matrix types return `C`.** They used to return the inner
  field (`C.S` / `C.A` / `C.B`), violating the LinearAlgebra contract. This made `MomentumMethod` and
  `Adam` unusable on a bare `Manifold`: for a `StiefelManifold` of size (3, 1), `_mul` degraded a
  (3, 3) `StiefelLieAlgHorMatrix` into a (2, 1) `Matrix`, and the two algorithms then died with
  `DimensionMismatch` and `CanonicalIndexError`. ([#17])
- **`ParameterHandling.flatten(T, ::Manifold)` round-trips the manifold type.** It reconstructed a
  `StiefelManifold` for every kind of manifold, so a `GrassmannManifold` came back Stiefel — with a
  different `rgrad` and a different retraction, and no error anywhere.
- **`Float32` parameter `NamedTuple`s are no longer silently promoted to `Float64`** by
  `ParameterHandling.flatten`, which defaults to `Float64`; the flattened vector was then incompatible
  with the parameters.
- **`GlobalSection` is more tightly parameterized** (`GlobalSection{T,AT<:AbstractArray{T},λT}`) and
  copies its `Y` on construction. `update_section!` gained a four-argument form
  `update_section!(Λᵗ, Λ⁽ᵗ⁻¹⁾, B, retraction)` that writes into a separate destination; the
  three-argument form forwards to it in place.
- **An unimplemented retraction now errors** and names the retraction and the argument type. The
  fallback had an empty body, so it returned `nothing` and failed further downstream with a message
  about `Nothing`.

### Changed (breaking) — dependencies

- **Zygote is dropped** in favour of **ForwardDiff** — the unified interface differentiates a scalar
  objective of a small parameter set, which is what ForwardDiff is good at — and **ParameterHandling**,
  whose `flatten` / `unflatten` pair turns a `NamedTuple` of arrays into the vector the Euclidean
  methods want.
- **SimpleSolvers is now `0.10`** (was `0.8`), and the **minimum Julia version is 1.10** (was 1.0),
  which is SimpleSolvers 0.10's floor and the oldest version CI has ever tested.

  SimpleSolvers 0.9 reworked `Options`, so several keywords that used to be accepted here are gone:
  `g_restol`, `x_abstol_break`, `x_reltol_break`, `f_reltol_break` and `g_restol_break`. This does not
  change stopping behaviour at default settings — every removed `*_break` field defaulted to `Inf`,
  and the gradient residual is now gated on `f_reltol`, whose default `√eps(T)` is the number
  `g_restol` used to default to. The successive change in `f` is gated on the new `f_suctol`, which
  inherited `f_reltol`'s former default.

### Fixed

- `zeros(SkewSymMatrix, n)` threw a `MethodError` about `zero(::Type{SkewSymMatrix})` — the
  non-parametric method had been dropped — including for its only in-repo caller,
  `zeros(::Type{StiefelLieAlgHorMatrix}, N, n)`. Both are public API.
- `Optimizer(x, problem)` sized its default gradient with `length(x)`, which for a `NamedTuple` is the
  number of *entries* and not the length of its flattening, so the first step failed with a
  `DimensionMismatch`. The choice now lives in `default_gradient`.
- `OptimizerCache` for a method with no matching cache — in practice an `Adam{Float64}` handed
  `Float32` parameters — reported a bare `MethodError`; it now says that `Adam` has to be constructed
  with the element type of the parameters.
- `GrassmannLieAlgHorMatrix` gained explicit `copy`, `zero`, `copyto!`, `fill!` and `similar` methods.
  The generic `AbstractArray` fallbacks route through `setindex!`, which it does not define, and its
  `similar` handed a two-parameter concrete type to `zeros`, which has no such method.

### Added

- **`OptimizerSolution`**, the union of `AbstractVector`, `Manifold` and `ArrayNamedTuple`, so that a
  single method signature covers all three — together with `named_tuple_wrapper.jl`, which supplies
  the elementwise arithmetic (`_copy`, `_zero`, `_add!`, `_mul`, `norm`) that the Euclidean code
  performs on plain vectors.
- **Heterogeneous and non-`Float64` parameter `NamedTuple`s.** `ArrayTuple` and `GlobalSectionTuple`
  were written as `Tuple{Vararg{AT}} where {AT<:…}`, which Julia's diagonal rule makes homogeneous — a
  `NamedTuple` holding a `StiefelManifold` and an ordinary `Matrix` at the same time was therefore not
  an `ArrayNamedTuple`. They are covariant now.
- `GradientFunction(F, ∇F!, nt::NamedTuple)`, so that a hand-written gradient can be used for
  parameters stored in a `NamedTuple`.
- `GlobalSection` now travels with the optimizer state rather than living inside the cache, with the
  accessors and in-place methods that `solver_step!` needs.
- `default_gradient` and `default_linesearch`, which name the two choices `Optimizer` makes when the
  caller does not supply a gradient or a line search.

### Known issues

- Type piracy in `l2norm`, `ParameterHandling.flatten`, `Gradient` and `outer!`, catalogued in the
  source. `ArrayNamedTuple` and `GlobalSectionNamedTuple` are type *aliases* for `NamedTuple`, so
  dispatching on them is dispatching on Base; a wrapper `struct` would make most of it legal. ([#16])
- Bare `Manifold` parameters are only partially supported ([#27]).
- `mode = :finitediff` throws a `MethodError` on `NamedTuple` parameters ([#24]).
- No documentation page describes the unified optimizer interface yet ([#25]).
- The `|g(x) - g(x')|` convergence *measure* is structurally zero for `Newton`. `solver_step!`
  refreshes `state.ḡ` at the same iterate the cache takes its gradient at, so the difference the
  status reports is always `0`. It is display-only — no stopping criterion reads it — but it is the
  same defect class as the quasi-Newton one fixed above, in the code path marked "this will have to be
  removed later".
