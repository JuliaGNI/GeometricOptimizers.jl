# The `CUDA` version of `mnist.jl`. Everything that concerns the network — the batches, the
# forward pass and the `Zygote` gradient — is evaluated on the GPU; the *parameters* and the
# `Optimizer` stay on the host.
#
# The reason for that split is the parameter interface of `GeometricOptimizers`: the
# optimizer flattens its parameter `NamedTuple` with `ParameterHandling.flatten` on every
# step (see `(grad::Gradient)(::ArrayNamedTuple)` in `src/optimizers/named_tuple_wrapper.jl`)
# and `ParameterHandling.flatten` has no method for GPU arrays — a `CuVector` falls through
# to `ParameterHandling.flatten(::Type, ::AbstractVector)`, which maps over the *elements* of
# the vector. `_similar(::StiefelManifold)` allocates on the host as well. Neither of the two
# is a problem here, because the optimizer only ever touches the 154938 parameters (620 kB in
# `Float32`), whereas the forward and backward passes touch the whole batch (2048 images
# through 16 transformer blocks). Per optimizer step the parameters are uploaded and the
# gradient is downloaded once, i.e. about 1.2 MB of traffic; everything expensive happens on
# the device.
#
# Run it inside `screen`, through the wrapper next to it:
#
#   screen -S mnist
#   scripts/run_mnist_cuda.sh                       # detach with C-a d, come back with -r
#
# or start it detached in one go, which is what an ssh session is for:
#
#   screen -dmS mnist scripts/run_mnist_cuda.sh
#
# The wrapper only sets the environment variables below and launches this script; running
# `julia --project=scripts scripts/mnist_cuda.jl` by hand inside a `screen` is the same thing.
#
# `screen` because the four trainings at `n_epochs = 500` are 58000 optimizer steps and this
# script has never been timed on a CUDA device — the ≈36 h in `WORKPLAN.md` is extrapolated
# from three epochs on an M4 Max through `mnist_metal.jl`, and the RTX 4090 should be well
# under that, but by how much is not known. Either way it is longer than an ssh session should
# be expected to survive. `tail -f mnist_cuda_report.txt` follows it from a second window; the
# first epoch line gives the per-epoch time, so the total is `4 · n_epochs ·` that.
#
# `CUDA` is part of `scripts/Project.toml`; it installs (but is not functional) on platforms
# without a CUDA device, so `mnist.jl` still works in the same environment. If no device is
# available this script runs on the host as well, so that it can be tested without a GPU —
# but at the 500 epochs of the original that is not a practical option.
#
# Apart from the device the setup is identical to `mnist.jl`: same network, same
# initialization (drawn on the host with the same seed) and the same four trainings, so the
# results of the two scripts are directly comparable.
#
# On device memory: `Zygote` keeps every intermediate of the forward pass alive for the
# backward pass, which at `L = 16` and a batch size of 2048 is roughly 80 MB per transformer
# block, i.e. about 3 GB including the backward pass itself. If that does not fit, reduce
# `batch_size` (the number of batches per epoch adapts automatically).
#
# ## The report
#
# Nobody watches a run this long, and the terminal it was started in is not where its results
# will be read, so everything the script learns is also written to a plain text file:
#
#   mnist_cuda_report.txt     the environment, the gradient checks, one line per epoch, the
#                             per-run summaries and the verdict — flushed after every line
#   mnist_cuda_losses.csv     one row per optimizer step: run, epoch, batch, step, loss
#   mnist_parameters.jld2     the trained parameters, the per-batch and per-epoch losses, the
#                             timings and the accuracies — rewritten after every configuration
#
# All three are self-contained: they can be copied off the machine and read without it. The
# first two need nothing but a text editor, which the `.jld2` does — JLD2 writes a subset of
# HDF5, so `h5py` opens it, but the parameters come back as Julia types. Because the report is
# flushed line by line, the CSV after every epoch and the `.jld2` after each of the four
# configurations, a run that dies in configuration three still leaves configurations one and
# two complete, together with every epoch of three up to the point it died. A configuration
# that throws is caught, reported and does not take the remaining ones down with it; a loss
# that turns non-finite ends that configuration early rather than spending the rest of its
# schedule on a run that cannot recover.
#
# The environment variables below override the schedule, so that the machine can be tried out
# before it is committed to the whole run:
#
#   MNIST_N_EPOCHS        epochs per configuration        (default 500; use 2 for a smoke test)
#   MNIST_BATCH_SIZE      images per batch                (default 2048)
#   MNIST_ACCURACY_EVERY  epochs between test evaluations (default 25, `0` disables them)
#   MNIST_REPORT          path of the report              (default mnist_cuda_report.txt)
#   MNIST_LOSSES          path of the loss CSV            (default mnist_cuda_losses.csv)
#   MNIST_OUTPUT          path of the `.jld2`             (default mnist_parameters.jld2)
#   MNIST_PROGRESS        print the per-batch progress line (default: only on a terminal)
#
# A smoke test — two epochs of each configuration, writing both files exactly as the full run
# does, and its epoch lines are what the schedule of the full run should be extrapolated from:
#
#   scripts/run_mnist_cuda.sh --smoke

Whether a configuration did what it is supposed to do, and if not, why.

Two criteria apply to every run — the parameters survived and, on a manifold, stayed on it.
The remaining two depend on `learns`: a configuration that is expected to learn has to reduce
its loss and classify above `accuracy_floor`, while the unconstrained one is expected to
collapse onto the trivial prediction and is checked against that plateau instead. Note that
this makes *learning* a failure for the latter — not because learning would be bad, but
because it would mean this script is no longer running the experiment of the paper.

The bars are those of the *full* run. A short schedule is judged on what it can show: the loss
decrease is read off the per-batch series when there are not two epochs to compare, and the
accuracy is not judged at all below `accuracy_floor_min_epochs`, where a configuration that is
working still has no chance of clearing the floor.
