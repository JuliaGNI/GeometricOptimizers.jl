# The `Metal` version of `mnist.jl`, i.e. `mnist_cuda.jl` for the GPU of an Apple silicon Mac.
# Everything that concerns the network — the batches, the forward pass and the `Zygote`
# gradient — is evaluated on the GPU; the *parameters* and the `Optimizer` stay on the host.
#
# The reason for that split is the parameter interface of `GeometricOptimizers`: the
# optimizer flattens its parameter `NamedTuple` with `ParameterHandling.flatten` on every
# step (see `(grad::Gradient)(::ArrayNamedTuple)` in `src/optimizers/named_tuple_wrapper.jl`)
# and `ParameterHandling.flatten` has no method for GPU arrays — an `MtlVector` falls through
# to `ParameterHandling.flatten(::Type, ::AbstractVector)`, which maps over the *elements* of
# the vector. `_similar(::StiefelManifold)` allocates on the host as well. Neither of the two
# is a problem here, because the optimizer only ever touches the 154938 parameters (620 kB in
# `Float32`), whereas the forward and backward passes touch the whole batch (2048 images
# through 16 transformer blocks). Per optimizer step the parameters are copied to the device
# and the gradient is copied back once, i.e. about 1.2 MB of traffic; everything expensive
# happens on the device. Note that the memory of an Apple GPU is *unified*, so those copies
# do not cross a bus — but they are still copies, as an `MtlArray` does not share its storage
# with the `Array` it was built from.
#
# Run it with
#
#   julia --project=scripts -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("Metal")'   # once, on the Mac
#   julia --project=scripts scripts/mnist_metal.jl
#
# `Metal` is deliberately *not* a dependency of `scripts/Project.toml`: it cannot be resolved
# on Linux, and a project that lists it leaves the whole environment unprecompilable there,
# which is what stopped the first attempt at `mnist_cuda.jl` on the RTX 4090. So the machine
# that has a Metal device adds it by hand. That `Pkg.add` writes `Metal` back into
# `scripts/Project.toml` — keep the line out of commits. Unlike `CUDA`, `Metal` does not
# *load* on platforms it does not support, so this script is for macOS on Apple silicon only
# — the other two scripts still work in the same environment everywhere. If no device is available this one runs on
# the host, so that it can be tested without a GPU — but at the 500 epochs of the original
# that is not a practical option.
#
# Apart from the device the setup is identical to `mnist.jl`: same network, same
# initialization (drawn on the host with the same seed) and the same four trainings, so the
# results of the three scripts are directly comparable. The network is `Float32` throughout,
# which is what `Metal` supports (`Float64` is not available on an Apple GPU).
#
# On device memory: `Zygote` keeps every intermediate of the forward pass alive for the
# backward pass, which at `L = 16` and a batch size of 2048 is roughly 80 MB per transformer
# block, i.e. about 3 GB including the backward pass itself. That is well within the working
# set size that the GPU recommends (printed below), but if it does not fit, reduce
# `batch_size` (the number of batches per epoch adapts automatically).
#
# Those intermediates are *not* released on their own, and on unified memory that takes the
# whole machine down rather than merely erroring — see the section on device memory below,
# which is the one substantial difference to `mnist_cuda.jl`. Everything the network does on
# the device therefore runs inside a `device_scope`, and a memory budget stops the script if
# it ever grows out of it again.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------- device memory ---

# The memory of an `MtlArray` is allocated by Metal, not by Julia, and keeping it bounded
# needs *two* things per step — neither of which works on its own:
#
#   * `Metal.@autoreleasepool`. A kernel launch autoreleases its command buffer and a command
#     buffer retains every buffer it refers to, so without a pool that drains, the command
#     buffers of the forward and backward passes accumulate in the outermost pool — which in
#     a script never drains — and hold on to every intermediate. No amount of garbage
#     collection frees those, because the reference that keeps them alive is on the
#     Objective-C side.
#   * `GC.gc(false)`. Conversely the pool can only drop a buffer once the `MtlArray` owning it
#     has been finalized, and Julia's collector is driven by the size of the *Julia* heap: an
#     `MtlArray` is a few hundred bytes of Julia object in front of hundreds of megabytes of
#     Metal buffer, so it does not fire anywhere near often enough by itself.
#
# Measured over ten gradient steps at a batch size of 512 (M4 Max, `Metal` 1.10, `scripts/
# metal_memory_probe.jl`), as reported by `Metal.device().currentAllocatedSize`:
#
#     neither                     0.5 → 4.2 GB, climbing by 0.41 GB per step
#     `GC.gc(true)` per step      0.4 → 4.1 GB, i.e. a full collection changes nothing
#     pool per step               0.7 → 12.4 GB between the collections that happen to occur
#     pool *and* `GC.gc(false)`   0.31 GB, flat, at no measurable cost in time
#
# Without this the script grows without bound — at a batch size of 2048 by about 1.6 GB per
# step. That is worse than it sounds on an Apple GPU: the memory is *unified*, an allocation
# does not fail when it runs out, and so instead of an error one gets compression, then
# paging, and then a system that has to be power-cycled. Hence the budget below as well.

# The same four trainings as in the original script. `Adam` takes the *element type* of the
# parameters, not a learning rate, and it is not converted the way `MomentumMethod` is, so
# `Adam(T)` is what dispatches to the `Float32` cache.
#
# `regular weights, Adam` is the *baseline* and is not expected to learn. It is the one
# configuration whose attention projections are unconstrained, and with 16 transformer blocks
# and no layer normalization, dropout or pre-training the gradient reaching the early blocks
# vanishes: the network collapses onto a constant prediction and stays there. This is the
# published result of B. Brantner, "Generalizing Adam To Manifolds For Efficiently Training
# Transformers" (§"Numerical Example: the Transformer"), where the loss is "stuck at around
# 1.34, which indicates a trivial prediction". The number is reproduced by `network_loss`
# here: `‖pred − out‖/‖out‖` for a constant prediction over one-hot targets is
# `√(2·(1 − 1/10)) = √1.8 ≈ 1.342`. Putting the projections on the Stiefel manifold is what
# removes the problem — `YᵀY = I`, so a block neither amplifies nor damps what passes through
# it — and that is why the other three configurations learn. A flat loss here is the
# experiment working, not a defect.
