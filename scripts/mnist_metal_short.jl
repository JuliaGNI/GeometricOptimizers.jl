# A *two hour* version of `mnist_metal.jl`, for the Apple silicon GPU.
#
# `mnist_metal.jl` runs the four trainings of the original script at `n_epochs = 500`, which
# on an M4 Max is ≈36 h. That is the run that produces publishable numbers, and it should be
# started only once there is reason to believe it will not waste a day and a half. This script
# is that check: it establishes, inside a wall clock budget it is given (two hours by
# default), that the machinery is correct and that every configuration does what the paper
# says it should — which for three of the four means learning, and for the fourth means not
# learning (see below).
#
# Run it with
#
#   julia --project=scripts -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("Metal")'   # once, on the Mac; see mnist_metal.jl
#   julia --project=scripts scripts/mnist_metal_short.jl
#
# and optionally override the budget or the batch size from the environment:
#
#   MNIST_TIME_BUDGET=1800 julia --project=scripts scripts/mnist_metal_short.jl
#   MNIST_BATCH_SIZE=512   julia --project=scripts scripts/mnist_metal_short.jl
#
# ## How the budget is spent
#
# The schedule is *derived*, not guessed. After the data is loaded and the gradient check has
# compiled the forward and backward passes, the script times a handful of real optimizer steps
# and divides the remaining budget by the number of configurations. So the run finishes inside
# the budget on any machine, and `n_epochs` is whatever that machine can afford — the number
# is reported before the training starts. A per-run deadline truncates a configuration that
# turns out to be slower than the calibration suggested, and says so in the table.
#
# All configurations get the *same* `n_epochs`, so their losses and accuracies stay
# comparable with each other. They are of course not comparable with a 500 epoch run.
#
# ## `regular weights, Adam` is not supposed to learn
#
# One of the four configurations — the one *without* the Stiefel constraint — sits at chance
# with a flat loss, and that is the point of the experiment rather than a defect. It is the
# published result of
#
#   B. Brantner, *Generalizing Adam To Manifolds For Efficiently Training Transformers*
#
# whose §"Numerical Example: the Transformer" reports that the vision transformer with
# unconstrained projections and no layer normalization, dropout or pre-training "is not able to
# learn much, as the error rate is stuck at around 1.34, which indicates a trivial prediction".
# With 16 transformer blocks and nothing normalizing between them, the gradient that reaches
# the early blocks vanishes; the network collapses onto a constant prediction eᵢ and stays
# there. Constraining the projections to the Stiefel manifold is what removes the problem —
# `YᵀY = I` means a block neither amplifies nor damps what passes through it — and that is why
# the other three configurations learn. Orthonormality is being used here in place of the
# heuristics (normalization, dropout, regularization) that a transformer usually needs.
#
# The `1.34` is reproduced exactly by this script's loss. `network_loss` is
# `‖pred − out‖/‖out‖`; over a batch of `k` one-hot targets a trivial prediction is wrong on
# 9 of 10 images and off by `√2` on each, so the loss is `√(2·0.9·k)/√k = √1.8 ≈ 1.342`. The
# three epoch run of 2026-08-07 measured `1.327 → 1.330` at an accuracy of `0.1049`, i.e. the
# plateau and chance.
#
# So this configuration is judged against the plateau instead of against the accuracy floor:
# it passes when it lands there, which is what reproduces the paper.
#
# ## What this establishes, and what it does not
#
# It establishes that
#
#   * `∇F!` agrees with a host side directional derivative, for Stiefel *and* for regular
#     weights — `mnist_metal.jl` only checks the Stiefel case;
#   * the device memory stays inside its budget for the whole run (the `device_scope` fix);
#   * every Stiefel configuration takes steps that reduce the loss;
#   * the Stiefel parameters are still on the manifold at the end, and everything is still
#     `Float32` and finite;
#   * every Stiefel configuration classifies well above the 10 % of chance, and the
#     unconstrained one sits at the trivial-prediction plateau.
#
# It does *not* establish the accuracy the full runs reach. A few hundred steps is a few per
# cent of the original schedule, so the accuracies below are a signal that learning happens,
# not a result. Comparing against the accuracies of the original script needs the full run on
# the RTX 4090.
#
# ## On `batch_size`
#
# The default is the `2048` of `mnist_metal.jl`, so that this script differs from it in
# exactly one dimension — the length of the schedule. Anything surprising here can then be
# attributed to the short schedule and not to a changed optimization problem.
#
# The work per *epoch* is independent of the batch size, so a smaller batch buys proportionally
# more optimizer steps for the same wall clock: at `MNIST_BATCH_SIZE=512` the same two hours
# are ≈4× the parameter updates and therefore a much stronger accuracy signal. It also changes
# the gradient noise, i.e. the optimization problem, which is why it is not the default.

"""
    verdict(result)

Whether a configuration did what it is supposed to do, and if not, why.

Two criteria apply to every run — the parameters survived and, on a manifold, stayed on it.
The remaining two depend on `learns`: a configuration that is expected to learn has to reduce
its loss and classify above `accuracy_floor`, while the unconstrained one is expected to
collapse onto the trivial prediction and is checked against that plateau instead. Note that
this makes *learning* a failure for the latter — not because learning would be bad, but
because it would mean this script is no longer running the experiment of the paper.
