# Run `scripts/mnist_cuda.jl` on the RTX 4090 workstation.
#
#   screen -S mnist                     # then, inside it:
#   scripts/run_mnist_cuda.sh --smoke   # two epochs each, ~1/250 of the full schedule
#   scripts/run_mnist_cuda.sh           # the real thing, 500 epochs each
#
# Detach with `C-a d`, log out, come back with `screen -r mnist`. Or start it detached in one
# go, which is what an ssh session is for:
#
#   screen -dmS mnist scripts/run_mnist_cuda.sh
#
# Either way the run leaves four files behind in `results/`, and they are the point of it:
#
#   <stamp>_report.txt      the environment, the gradient checks, one line per epoch, the
#                           per-run summaries and the verdict, flushed as it goes
#   <stamp>_losses.csv      one row per optimizer step: run, epoch, batch, step, loss
#   <stamp>_parameters.jld2 the trained parameters, the losses, the timings and the accuracies,
#                           rewritten after every configuration
#   <stamp>_stdout.txt      everything the process wrote, including a backtrace if it died
#
# `<stamp>` is the start time, so a second run never overwrites the first. Copy all four off
# the machine when it is done — they are self-contained.
#
# Run this from the repository root; it does not care where it is invoked from otherwise.
