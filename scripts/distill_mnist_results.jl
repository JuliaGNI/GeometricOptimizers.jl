# Distil one `mnist_cuda.jl` run into the three small series the documentation plots.
#
# The run itself leaves four files in `results/` (see `MNIST_PORT.md`), all of them gitignored:
# a report, a per-batch loss CSV of ~58000 rows, the trained parameters as a `.jld2` and the
# raw stdout. None of those belong in the repository — the CSV is 2.9 MB and the `.jld2` 2.9 MB,
# and the figures need neither the individual batches nor the parameters. What they do need is
# three series of at most 500 rows, which is what this script writes to `docs/src/data/`:
#
#   mnist_training_loss.csv    the per-epoch mean loss of all four configurations, 500 rows
#   mnist_test_accuracy.csv    the test accuracy, every 25 epochs, 20 rows
#   mnist_manifold_drift.csv   ‖YᵀY-I‖ for the three constrained runs, every 25 epochs, 20 rows
#
# Those three are checked in, so building the documentation needs neither a GPU nor the run.
# Rerun this after a new run to refresh them:
#
#   julia scripts/distill_mnist_results.jl results/20260808_212753_full
#
# The argument is the prefix the run shares; `_losses.csv` and `_report.txt` are appended. Only
# the standard library is used, so no project needs to be instantiated.

    epoch_losses(path)

Mean loss per epoch and configuration, from the per-batch CSV a run writes.

The CSV is `run,configuration,epoch,batch,step,loss` with the configuration quoted because it
contains a comma, which is why this is a regular expression and not a `split` on `,`. A line
that does not match is a corrupted tail of an interrupted run and is skipped rather than fatal.

The `epoch:value` series a run's report prints under `heading`, per configuration.

heading line followed by one line per configuration and terminated by a blank line. Reading them
here rather than recomputing anything keeps the checked-in files traceable to a line of the
report. The blank line is what separates the two blocks, so `.` must not match a newline here:
with the `s` flag the accuracy block would run on into the drift block and the drift numbers
would overwrite the accuracies.
